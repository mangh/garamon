=================

Garamon (Geometric Algebra Recursive and Adaptative Monster) is a generator of C++ libraries dedicated to Geometric Algebra.
From a configuration file, the library generator generate the source code of the specified Algebra as well as a compatible sample code and some documentation.

Usage
=====

```sh
~/garamon/build$ ./garamon_generator --help
GARAMON: Geometric Algebra Recursive and Adaptative MONster Generator

./garamon_generator [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
  -h,  --help                      Print this help message and exit
  -c,  --config REQUIRED           Configuration file, e.g. "garamond/conf/c3ga.conf"
  -t,  --template REQUIRED         Template directory, e.g. "garamond/data/"
  -o,  --output REQUIRED           Output directory, e.g. "garamond/build/output/"

~/garamon/build$
```

## Generate a library

    * define the algebra to generate: chose a configuration file (.conf) on the 'conf' directory or create your own.
    * run the binary executable (from the 'build' directory) with the configuration file as argument
      > ./garamon_generator -c ../conf/ga.conf -t ../data/ -o ./output/
    * the generated library is located in 'build/output' directory
    * to install the generated library, see its README.md

## Run the Python binding sample for a specific algebra
Let us consider the considered algebra is CGA of R3 corresponding to the configuration file c3ga.conf. 

    * Check the dependencies (in particular `pip install pybind11`, Python 3 development headers and CMake 3.18 or more)
    * From Garamon Generator root directory
    	* 'mkdir build'
    	* 'cd build'
    	* 'cmake ..'
    	* 'make'
        * './garamon_generator -c ../conf/c3ga.conf -t ../data/ -o ./output/'
    	* 'cd output/garamon_c3ga/'
    	* 'cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_PYTHON=ON' (¹)
    	* 'cmake --build build --config Release'
    	* 'cmake --build build --config Release --target python_sample' (runs 'sample/sample.py' with the just-built module)
    	* (optional) 'cmake --install build --config Release --component python' (²) to make the module importable from anywhere, then:
    		* 'cd sample'
    		* 'python sample.py'

(1) The `cmake -S ...` command requires the Eigen3 library. It will fail if it can't find it.
You might need to add the `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/eigen3` parameter to point to where the library is.

(2) The module is installed into the site-packages of the Python interpreter found by CMake, which usually requires admin rights (`sudo`, or an elevated terminal on Windows).
Either install to your per-user site-packages instead, by adding `-DPYTHON_INSTALL_DIR="$(python -m site --user-site)"` to the `cmake -S ...` command,
or activate a virtual environment (`python -m venv .venv`) before the `cmake -S ...` command: CMake then uses it and installs the module there.


Tests
=====

The unit tests use [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) (v3) and CTest. They are built by default (CMake option `GARAMON_BUILD_TESTS`):

```sh
~/garamon$ cmake -S . -B build
~/garamon$ cmake --build build
~/garamon$ ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

* `generator_tests`: unit tests of the generator itself (configuration parser, metric analysis, product tables, code generation, ...)
* `<algebra>_tests`: the algebras `c3ga`, `c5ga`, `e3ga` and `p3ga`, as well as two test algebras with a non-normalized and a non-orthogonal metric (`tests/conf/`), are generated at build time; each generated library is compared with an independent reference implementation of the geometric algebra (`tests/algebras/reference/CliffordReference.hpp`)
* `<algebra>: sample`: the generated sample program is compiled and run.

To run a part of the tests, e.g. the c3ga dual tests: `build/tests/c3ga_tests "[dual]"`, or `ctest --test-dir build -R c3ga`.
